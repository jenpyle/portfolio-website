        <p class="about-body__bio">I am a recent graduate of Colorado State University, with a major in Mechanical
          Engineering and minor in Computer Science. As I started taking computer science classes to enhance my
          Mechanical
          Engineering I found that I was so excited and passionate about my coding classes. Because of this, I have
          decided that I want to start my career in the computer science industry!<br><br> I currently have about 3
          years
          of
          coding experience. I believe that my engineering knowledge will aid my programming skills, as I can apply both
          fields of knowledge to design, testing, and development components of projects. I am currently looking for
          Software Developer/Engineer and Full-Stack Developer jobs located in Fort Collins and the northern Colorado
          region. I cannot accept fully remote positions at this time </p>

      <p>When I'm not coding, I love spending time outdoors in my beautiful state of Colorado.
        I'm always up for a camping trip or hiking a new trail. I also enjoy getting exercise
        by mountain biking or rock climbing! I also love new adventures and traveling
